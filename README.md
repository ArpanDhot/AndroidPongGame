## Overview

This repository provides a basic implementation of the classic Pong game for Android, featuring a Player vs Computer mode. The computer opponent starts tracking the ball's x and y coordinates once a certain x-location is passed. This project offers a simple yet challenging Pong game experience that can be easily modified and expanded upon.

## Game Description

Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It simulates table tennis where a player controls a paddle by dragging it vertically across the screen's left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike the ball back and forth.
